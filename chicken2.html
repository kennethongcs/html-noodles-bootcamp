      <p>Instructions:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li> 1. To make the chicken stir fry noodles recipe: In a large pot
      with boiling salted water, cook the spaghetti according to package
      directions. Add the broccoli florets the last 5 minutes of cooking and let
      them cook with pasta until tender. Drain the noodles and broccoli and set
      aside. </li>
        <li> 2. While pasta is cooking, whisk together the brown sugar, soy
      sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, ginger, red pepper, and black pepper in a
      small bowl. </li>
        <li>3. Season chicken strips to taste with salt and pepper. Add
      olive oil to a medium-sized skillet and cook chicken in an even layer over
      medium heat, turning from time to time for 2 or 3 minutes, until slightly
      golden. Stir in the garlic, and carrots and cook for a minute more, until
      cooked through but not overdone. </li>
        <li> 4. Transfer the cooked spaghetti and
      broccoli to the skillet and pour the sauce on top and toss until fully
      incorporated. Reheat for a couple of minutes and serve the chicken stir
      fry noodles, garnished with scallion and toasted sesame seeds. Enjoy!</li>
